          <div class="body-text">Hi, welcome to my first project I'm documenting which happens to be this site. I am a student so I was looking at the github student developer pack and I discovered there was several reasources to host and explore the idea of hosting my own small blog/portfolio. I managed to find a domain with one of the included providers and github has it's own github pages hosting which is free. I looked into several jekyll themes that I could work off and initially I found Al-Folio which seemed like a good start but I discovered it uses several plugins that the github deployment system does not support. Normally this wouldn't be an issue as I could clone the repo to my own computer and push it up to github once I had finished working on it but as I was doing this on my school laptop it forced me to use exclusively online tools. Enter ndoherty's folio template which doesn't include any plugins and looks extremely clean. I picked his repo and cloned it and this was when I discovered as part of the Student Pack it includes github pro for as long as I am in school. In turn, this lets me use <a href="github.dev">github.dev</a> as a fully fledged code editor. I have been learning html and css in my software classes at school so this was a nice exercise, analysing and understanding how the site is setup while editing it to be what I want.</div>

              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
