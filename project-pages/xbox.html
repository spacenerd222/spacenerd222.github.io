          <div class="body-text">The Xbox360 is one of the most well known video game consoles as gaming was rising in popularity very quickly at that time. I bought several xboxs and spent some nights messing around and learning how to mod them with RGH glitches and get my own software on it. This allowed for ISO games and other homebrew applications to run. This wasn't enough for me so I came up with the unnecessary idea of watercooling it. I decided to go with a Cougar AIO as it had a mounting bracket that had a similar mounting location to the stock cooler. Once it had arrived, I cut the mounting bracket to fit and it sat on the cpu flawlessly. I then created the supporting modifications to the case and cut out a hole for the AIO to be visible. The power was initially intended to run off the inbuilt power lines but the increased power draw from the pump and RGB lights caused instability so I resorted to using a external 12V power supply directly wired up to the AIO. Along with the extreme cooling I modified the xbox with a Ace V1 chip to preform a RGH glitch and allow for modding. The project turned out quite successful and it was very fun to run through the whole process of idea to research then creating it and finally being able to admire the final product. Unfortunately most of the photos I had were lost and not backed up but the ones that I do have are attached below.  </div>
